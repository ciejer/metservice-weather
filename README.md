# MetService-Weather Custom Component for Home Assistant
Credit to https://github.com/jaydeethree/Home-Assistant-weatherdotcom and https://github.com/alexander0042/pirate-weather-ha/tree/master/custom_components/pirateweather for helping me through.

This Custom Component provides MetService NZ connectivity, including forecast, tides, UV, Laundry Drying Times (my reason for creating), and others.
Please raise an issue or PR for anything you'd like added, or any bugs (there will be some! I tested about 5 locations and all working, but there's some weirdness around different areas)
